## 🚧 Construction

The code base is still in early development as I speedrun' most parts of the game. I'll keep pushing more organized code in the near future.



## 🎉 Features

- Realtime Games vs. Friends & Strangers
- Complete Implementation of all rules
- Game Engine for Front- & Backend JS projects

## 👩‍💻 How to setup

Clone the repository and install the dependencies for the server & frontend using `yarn` (or npm):

```shell
# in repo root
yarn install
yarn --cwd client install
```

Then start the game server:
```shell
# in repo root
yarn run dev 
```

Then start the frontend using:
```shell
# in repo root

That's it 🎉 Follow the instructions on your terminal to open chess 2 and start developing :).
